# SG_Reno_Contractors

Purpose of this code is to allow customers to easily check the reviews of their desired contractors

## Business Case

Many homeowners who are looking for contractors face a pain point where they do not know which contractors to trust or are good. 

I want to create a simplified platform where customers are able to easily search the reviews for their contractors through various sources.

## Use Case

This code aims to help customers easily find reviews on their desired contractor via a Google, Google Maps and other Renovation websites like Qanvast and Renoation.

Running the code will prompt the user to input the name of the contractor they wish to search. 

It will then provide links to for reviews for the particular company.
